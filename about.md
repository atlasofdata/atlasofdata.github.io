### About the Project

#### The Monitoring of the Earth
The objective of this Atlas of Data is to investigate how the monitoring of the earth ecosystems works. We establish maps and visualisations of this global information system to study its laws (positive feedbacks, resistance, etc). Our purpose is also to evaluate if the present information system is adapted to the multiple challenges of climate
change.


#### Open Access

The Atlas of Data intends to become a resource for scientists, teachers, students and policy-makers that want to understand how production and consumption of data relate to our planet ecosystem. All resources published on this website will be released under Open Access license and made available for reuse in the public domain.

#### The Integration of Nature and Technology

The appropriation by humans of a large part of the biosphere and the
development of technological systems encompassing the whole planet has lead to an extreme intricacy between social and natural phenomena. Monitoring the earth ecosystem can therefore only be achieved by considering information collected from natural, human and technological activities.

#### Conflicting Interests in Human Societies

So far, the integration between socio-economic and natural monitoring systems has been very limited. While here are very serious political reasons to resist further integration, weaker systems are also impeding key areas of monitoring activities - traceability and circulation of raw  materials and products for instance. Such conflicting interests in human societies leading to new organisational mechanisms to redefine data production and integration.


#### Digital Platforms & Positive Feedback Loops

In the last decades, very large digital platforms have emerged, reaching billions of users and replacing crude oil industries as the largest market capitalisations. Their growth is based on positive feedback loops. The quality of their services increases with their number of users and the quantity of data they control. Such feedback loops exist in the meteorological industry, but are absent from most global ecosystems monitoring systems at this stage.


### Methodology

Most relevant data are inaccessible for research purposes. Most often, they are under the control of corporations or administrations that do not intent to disclose them for a large spectrum of reasons. Sometimes though, they are accessible but on incompatible formats. On some occasions, a possibility is given to use these data and show results on social or natural ecosystems. This is what we aim to do on domains for which data is often lacking to answer fundamental questions.
