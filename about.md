The Atlas of Data is a non-profit initiative by scientists and citizens.

### Team

- Clément Renaud (EPFL, IXXI) Founder
- Stéphane Grumbach (INRIA, IXXI) Scientific advisor


#### The Monitoring of the Earth

The objective of this Atlas of Data is to investigate how the monitoring of the earth ecosystems works. We establish maps and visualisations of this global information system to study its laws (positive feedbacks, resistance, etc). Our purpose is also to evaluate if the present information system is adapted to the multiple challenges of climate
change.


#### Open Access

The Atlas of Data intends to become a resource for scientists, teachers, students and policy-makers that want to understand how production and consumption of data relate to our planet ecosystem. All resources published on this website will be released under Open Access license and made available for reuse in the public domain.

#### The Integration of Nature and Technology

The appropriation by humans of a large part of the biosphere and the
development of technological systems encompassing the whole planet has lead to an extreme intricacy between social and natural phenomena. Monitoring the earth ecosystem can therefore only be achieved by considering information collected from natural, human and technological activities.

#### Conflicting Interests in Human Societies

So far, the integration between socio-economic and natural monitoring
systems has been very limited. While here are very serious political
reasons to resist further integration, weaker systems are also impeding key areas of monitoring activities - traceability and circulation of raw materials and products for instance. Such conflicting interests in human societies leading to new organizational mechanisms to redefine data production and integration.

#### Digital Platforms & Positive Feedback Loops

In the last decades, very large digital systems have emerged, reaching
billions of users and replacing crude oil as the biggest industrial
capitalizations on financial markets. Their growth is based on positive feedback loops: the quality of their services increase with the number of their users and the quantity of data they control. Such feedback loops exist in the meteorological industry, but are absent from most global ecosystems monitoring capacities.

### Methodology

Take inventory of the different forms taken by data on Earth will be an impossible task. Data avaibility is sporadic and many interesting
information does not exist under a well-structured format. In this
research, we select a few examples and approaches to provide a first set of insights that will help us refine a larger and more systematic
approach for this ongoing investigation.

#### Databases

We use existing databases to extract information and consider the
avaibility of information.

#### Fieldwork

We manually collect, aggregate and structure information about existing organizations and stakeholders of climate data.

#### Visualization

We use different technics of mapping and visualization to produce
representations of the observed phenomenons (exchanges, flows,
circulations, etc)
