## Why such an atlas?

The Atlas of Data maps the flows of data relevant to monitor the natural ecosystems. Where do the data come from? How are they collected? Where are they stored? Who controls them? Are they freely accessible?

Large amounts of data that could provide insightful knowledge about ecosystems are simply not accessible. Some because of technicalities such as poor formats, some because of economic or political incentives to protect or prevent access.

### The Metabolism of Digital systems

The digital sphere is formed by the connection to the network of zillions of very different entities, from the tiniest sensors to the largest data centers, from individual smartphones to large intermediation platforms connecting billions of users. This complex system interacts with various socio-economic systems. Its metabolism relies on positive and negative feedback loops favors or impedes the collection, exchanges and use of data.

In the Atlas of Data, each chapter illustrates a specific aspect of this metabolism by representing its interaction with relevant actors.

### The Frontiers of Representation

To apprehend this complex metabolism, new representations of the digital sphere are necessary. There is no standard way to map and measure similarities, centrality or periphery of nodes in dynamic networks where massive populations are interacting.

The Atlas of Data offers a space to explore the frontiers of representation by inviting not only scientists but also designers, artists, and visualisation practitioners. We lead creative experimentations to produce images, maps, or objects that support new forms of knowledge to understand the ongoing changes of our ecosystems.

### An Education platform

The Atlas of Data produces new knowledge and collects existing ones. Therefore, it is particularly suited for the development of pedagogical outcomes and curricula. We conduct workshops, where participants can be students, scientists, designers, artists, or anyone interested in exploring, studying and learning about data ecosystems locally or globally.

The material of the Atlas of Data can be freely used for teaching purposes.
