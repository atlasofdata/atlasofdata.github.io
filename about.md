The monitoring of Earth ecosystems by digital technologies extends far beyond scientific research and meteorological forecast to constitute the main way we control our world today. Our increasing reliance on digital technologies occurs while climate change is dramatically accelerating. As humans, we are facing a paradoxical equation: the data and machines we use to monitor and regulate ecosystems constitute also an important ecological threat to the planet.

### The Metabolism of Digital systems

The digital sphere is formed by the connection to the network of zillions of very different entities, from the tiniest sensors to the largest data centers, from individual smartphones to large intermediation platforms connecting billions of users. This complex system interacts with various socio-economic systems. Its metabolism relies on positive and negative feedback loops favors or impedes the collection, exchanges and use of data.

### The Frontiers of Representation

From global infrastructures to social apps, the mechanisms of interactions between socio-technical systems and the ecospheres are so complex that we lack the ability to form useful mental images. Still, the threat is real. We urgently need representations to conceive what is happening - and how we should act. There is no standard way to understand similarities, centrality, periphery or boundaries in such complex structures. To overcome our limitations, we construct new tools and experiences.

### Design & art

The Atlas of Data offers a space to explore the frontiers of representation by inviting not only scientists but also designers, artists, and visualisation practitioners. We lead creative experimentations to produce images, maps, or objects that support new forms of knowledge to understand the ongoing changes of our ecosystems.

### Open knowledge

The Atlas of Data produces new knowledge and collects existing ones. Everything we produce is available in the public domain. Therefore, it is particularly suited for the development of pedagogical outcomes and curricula.
