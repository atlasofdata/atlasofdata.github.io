The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the world leading institution regarding climate change challenges. It deals with the tremendous task to synthesize all human knowledge about the phenomenon and its implications for human society. A large number of authors and reviewers coming from all around the world write an Assessment Report approximately every 7 years. This visualization displays authors'and reviewers' nationalities for each assessment report and shows how IPCC is evolving from a United States driven institution to a world driven institution.
