              The Atlas of Data is an attempt to visualize flows of data related to our planet ecosystem.

          <p>
            Earth ecosystems are increasingly monitored by human and technological means. The growing flows of data thereby harvested serve a wide spectrum of purposes ranging from practical services, such as meteorological forecast, to the enhancement of scientific knowledge in earth and natural sciences.
        </p>
        <p>
            Increasingly, these data also reveal a profound evolution of the environment, affecting current balances, putting many species at risk, and constituting a threat for humanity as well. They also demonstrate the impact of human activities on the earth system through the modification of the chemical composition of the atmosphere or the ocean for instance. There is a growing quest to find solutions to this considerable challenge, and at the same time a growing doubt that humanity is politically organized in an appropriate form.

            The objective of this Atlas of Data, is to investigate how the global information system for the earth ecosystems monitoring works, in particular by establishing maps of the network of actors, visualisation of the data flows, and study of its laws, including feedback loops. Our purpose is also to evaluate if the present information system is at the level of the multiple challenges of climate change.

          <h3>Data Landscape & Territories</h3>
          <p>
            Information about activity of our planet comes in all forms and shapes. It is produced and used by thousands of actors for multiple purposes. The methods, tools, motivations and methods behind the production of climate data are driven by common or diverging interests (strategic, commercial, scientific, etc).
          </p>
          <h3>Open Access</h3>
          <p>
            The Atlas of Data intends to become a resource for scientists, teachers, students and policy-makers that want to engage in understanding how data flows relate to our planet ecosystem. All resources on this website will be released under Open Access license and made available for reuse in the public domain.

      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        Take inventory of the different forms taken by data on Earth will be an impossible task. Data avaibility is sporadic and many interesting information does not exist under a well-structured format. In this research, we select a few examples and approaches to provide a first set of insights that will help us refine a larger and more systematic approach for this ongoing investigation.

          <h5>SOCIETAL RESISTANCE TO TRANSPARENCY</h5>

          <p>
            The development of complex technological systems encompassing the whole planet and the appropriation by humans of a large part of the biosphere has lead to the extreme intricacy between social and natural phenomena. Monitoring the earth ecosystem can henceforth only be achieved by integrating information from natural, human and technological phenomena. At this stage, there is a very limited integration between socio-economic and natural  monitoring systems. But there are serious reasons for the weak integration, resulting from conflicting interests in human society, impeding real traceability of products for instance.

          <h5>DIGITAL PLATFORMS & POSITIVE FEEDBACK LOOPS</h5>
          <p>
            In the last decades, very large digital systems have emerged, They reach billions of users and have replaced crude oil industry as the top market capitalizations. Their growth is based on positive feedback loops, where the quality of their services increase with the number of their users and the quantity of data flows they control. Such feedback loops exist in the meteorological industry, but are absent from most global ecosystems monitoring capacities.
