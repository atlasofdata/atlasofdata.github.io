              The Atlas of Data is an attempt to visualize flows of data related to our planet ecosystem.

          </p>

          <p>
            Data about the Earth are increasingly strategic to understand the current condition of our planet and its evolution. A network is emerging associating an increasingly large number of actors from different regions and sectors, either informally through scientific cooperation or under the auspices of the United nations. It concentrates data harvested by the members, attempts to model the global ecosystem and makes predictions, to help design policies to adapt to and mitigate the impact of climate change.
          </p>
          <p>
            The present work aims to investigate this network as the interactions of the components of a complex system for global earth monitoring. It interacts with social, economic and political structures, generating frictions and feedback loops. We propose some insights of the underlying mechanisms of Earth data flows, exhibiting both resilience or impediments to the flows of information and knowledge which result from tensions between different interests. Data visualization are proposed to better understand the power relations at play.

            Information about activity of our planet comes in all forms and shapes. It is produced and used by thousands of actors for multiple purposes. The methods, tools, motivations and methods behind the production of climate data are driven by common or diverging interests (strategic, commercial, scientific, etc).

            The Atlas of Data intends to become a resource for scientists, teachers, students and policy-makers that want to engage in understanding how data flows relate to our planet ecosystem.

      <h3>Methodology</h3>
      <p>
        Take inventory of the different forms taken by data on Earth will be an impossible task. Data avaibility is sporadic and many interesting information does not exist under a well-structured format. In this research, we select a few examples and approaches to provide a first set of insights that will help us refine a larger and more systematic approach for this ongoing investigation.
