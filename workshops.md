### The Atlas of Data provides thematic content for participatory workshops inside and outside the classroom.

Based on questions and content from the website, we invite participants to explore, reflect and map data ecosystems.

If you are interested in running or organising a workshop, please get in touch at [workshops@theatlasofdata.earth](mailto:workshops@theatlasofdata.earth).
