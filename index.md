### {{site.description}}

The monitoring of Earth ecosystems by digital technologies extends far beyond scientific research and meteorological forecast to constitute the main way we control our world. Our increasing reliance on digital technologies occurs while climate change is dramatically accelerating. As humans, we are facing a paradoxical equation: the data and machines we use to monitor and regulate ecosystems constitute also an important ecological threat to the planet.

#### Exploring Digital Metabolism

The Atlas of Data is an exploration of the relationships between digital and natural ecosystems. From macro to micro, the Atlas describes a common metabolism where collection, exchanges and use of data is tied to our natural environment. More than a systematic inquiry, the Atlas is made of different experiments bordering art, design and science that depicts technological and ecological entanglements.

#### At the Frontiers of Representations

From global infrastructures to social apps, the mechanisms of interactions between socio-technical systems and the ecospheres are so complex that we lack the ability to form mental images. Still, the threat is real. We urgently need to forms representations and conceive what is happening - and how we should act. To explore unknown phenomena, we need to overcome that limitation and construct new tools and experiences.

### The Project

The Atlas of Data is a project started in 2019, currently a **work in progress**.

- *Scientific Curation*: we compile existing maps, visualisations and representations from academic literature.
- *Art & Design*: we explore new forms of representations by creating original artworks and design pieces.
- *Open Content*: we publish all content under open licenses for people to tweak and reuse
- *Education*: we collaborate with schools and stakeholders to organise workshops and curriculums around the topic
- *Global Networks*: we work on different continents to create solid relationships between people and organisations.

### A Gallery of Scientific Imagery

Large bodies of scientific works exist on topics related to climate or digital technologies. To get started on building the Atlas, we curate scientific works that feature interesting imagery - often cartography, network maps or visualisations. For each piece, we recreate a copy on the website in an interactive format and explicit the data that is used. Check the complete [list of datasets](/datasets).

### News & Events

The Atlas of Data take part in exhibitions and organise participatory workshops where participants can explore, reflect and map data ecosystems.
