### {{site.description}}

The monitoring of Earth ecosystems by digital technologies have became a central component of human societies. The harvesting of data extends today far beyond scientific domains and meteorological forecast to constitute the main apparatus for socio-economical control and regulation worldwide. This increase in digital technologies occurs while climate change is dramatically accelerating, leaving us with only a short time window to act for our own survival. As humans, we are facing a paradoxical equation: the data and machines we use to monitor and regulate ecosystems constitutes in itself an important ecological threat. How can we apprehend these contrary dynamics? How can we observe them? Are they related? What are they really made of? What can help us to consider them?

#### Exploring Digital Metabolism

The Atlas of Data is an exploration of the relationships between digital and natural ecosystems. More than a systematic inquiry, the Atlas contains different experiments realted to technological and biological entanglements at the borders of art, design and science. From macro to micro, the Atlas depicts how collection, exchanges and use of data is tied to our natural environment, describing a common metabolism.

#### At the Frontiers of Representations

From global infrastructures to your favourite social app, the mechanisms of interactions between socio-technical systems and the ecospheres are so complex that we lack the ability to form mental images. Still, the threat is real. We urgently need new forms of representations to conceive what is happening - and how we should act. Science has tools to observe - such as cartography, data visualisations or network maps - but limits itself to what is measurable today. To explore unknown phenomena, we need to overcome that limitation and construct new tools and experiences that will help us consider changing realities.

### The Project

The Atlas of Data is a project started in 2019, currently a **work in progress**.

- *Scientific curation*: we compile existing maps, visualisations and representations from academic literature.
- *Artistic Interpretation*: we explore new forms of representations by creating original artworks and design pieces.
- *Education*: we collaborate with schools and stakeholders to publish appropriable content under open licenses.
- *Global Networks*: we work on different continents to create solid relationships between people and organisations.


### A Gallery of Scientific Imagery

Large bodies of scientific works exist on topics related to climate or digital technologies. To get started on building the Atlas, we curate works that feature interesting imagery - often maps or visualisations - from relevant scientific literature. For each piece, we recreate a copy on the website in an interactive format and explicit the data that is used.

### News & Events

The Atlas of Data provides thematic content for participatory workshops where we invite participants to explore, reflect and map data ecosystems.
