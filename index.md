### {{site.description}}

The monitoring of Earth ecosystems by digital technologies extends far beyond scientific research and meteorological forecast to constitute the main way we control our world today. Our increasing reliance on digital technologies occurs while climate change is dramatically accelerating. As humans, we are facing a paradoxical equation: the data and machines we use to monitor and regulate ecosystems constitute also an important ecological threat to the planet.

#### Exploring Digital Metabolism

The Atlas of Data is an exploration of the relationships between digital and natural ecosystems. From macro to micro, the Atlas describes a common metabolism where collection, exchanges and use of data is tied to our natural environment. More than a systematic inquiry, the Atlas proceeds by experiments bordering art, design and science to depict technological and ecological entanglements.

#### At the Frontiers of Representations

From global infrastructures to social apps, the mechanisms of interactions between socio-technical systems and the ecospheres are so complex that we lack the ability to form useful mental images. Still, the threat is real. We urgently need representations to conceive what is happening - and how we should act. To overcome our limitations, we should construct new tools and experiences.

### The Project

The Atlas of Data is an online and offline project, organised in five chapters based on elements as depicted in Chinese traditional culture (五行) : metal, water, wood, fire and earth.

For each chapter, we collaborate with scientists to select a body of works from the most relevant academic literature. We extract existing imagery - such as maps and visualisations - and archive them on the present website under interactive formats. We explicit the [data sources](/datasets) and how they have been produced.

Based on this scientific corpus, we propose artistic interpretations in the form of interactive installations. All artworks are documented and released under public domain on this website for people to tweak and recreate. We collaborate with schools and local stakeholders worldwide to host workshops and exhibitions.
